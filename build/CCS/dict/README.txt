The file 'wordlist.dic' contains the entire wordlist that is loaded into CCS on startup.
Note that although adding words to it will work, this is not recommended,
as this file should be autogenerated by CCS from the remaining files in this directory.

If you wish to add words to the wordlist, add them to 'complete/myWords.txt' and then
delete 'wordlist.dic' so that CCS can rebuild it when it is next run.
Alternatively, if you add your word to any of the files in the 'categorised' directory,
CCS will include not only that word, but inflections of it as well. 

The default word lists in the 'categorised' directory (minus stopwords) come from wordnet's
resource files. Having additional words here that wordnet does not recognise is not hugely
useful as they cannot be used in synonym generation or word similarity calculation.
However, CCS will still take them into everywhere else.
